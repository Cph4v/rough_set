# Rough Set & Ant Colony Optimization

This project explores feature selection techniques combining **Rough Set Theory** with **Ant Colony Optimization** (ACO). The repository includes implementations of various algorithms, specifically tailored for optimization tasks within rough set-based systems.

## Features
- Ant Colony Optimization algorithms
- Rough Set Theory-based feature selection
- Jupyter notebooks with different algorithm variations
- Fuzzy rough set integration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cph4v/rough_set.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebooks for specific feature selection or optimization experiments.
- Modify parameters within the notebooks to explore new results.
